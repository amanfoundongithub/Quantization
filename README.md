## Model Used
We have used `GPT-2` for this task. It is available on Hugging Face in `GPT2LMHead` class.

## Dataset Used
We have used `Penn Tree Bank` dataset for this task. This dataset was taken from Hugging Face under the name `ptb_text_only`.Since only inference was demanded, we took the `test` split of the dataset.

This dataset contains around `3700` sentences.
